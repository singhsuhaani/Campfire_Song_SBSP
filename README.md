# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song 
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
Sitting by the fire, we all hold hands 
Hand in hand and hand in hand 
Stars in the sky, from dawn to dusk
We cheer, we cheer, we cheer
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song 
Make it all seem okay....
